Cucumber has three types of implementations:
* Full - all components adhere to the Cucumber architecture and are implemented in Dart
* Partial - Some components are implemented in Dart
* Custom - Something that looks like Cucumber from the outside but isn't really following the Cucumber way

Currently, `cornichon-dart` is what from the perspective of Cucumber would be called a _Custom_ implementation.
The idea is to turn Cornichon-Dart into a full Cucumber implementation over time.
