Cucumber has three types of implementations:
* Full - all components adhere to the Cucumber architecture and are implemented in Dart
* Partial - Some components are implemented in Dart
* Custom - Something that looks like Cucumber from the outside but isn't really following the Cucumber way

Currently, `cucumber-dart` is _Custom_.
But the idea is to turn Cucumber-Dart into Full implementation.
